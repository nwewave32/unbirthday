## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Establish patterns for Firebase services, error handling, and data management
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Create comprehensive Firebase integration patterns document
- [x] #2 Define Firebase configuration and environment setup
- [x] #3 Establish service architecture patterns
- [x] #4 Document authentication service patterns
- [x] #5 Define Firestore database operation patterns
- [x] #6 Document file storage service patterns

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Created comprehensive Firebase integration patterns document at docs/firebase-integration-patterns.md covering all aspects of Firebase integration including configuration, service architecture, authentication patterns, Firestore operations, file storage, error handling, type safety, security rules, performance optimization, and testing strategies. Document provides practical examples and best practices for Firebase 12.2.1 with TypeScript, including real-time subscriptions, batch operations, and comprehensive error handling patterns.
