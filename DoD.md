## Overview

The Definition of Done serves as a quality gate that ensures all work meets our standards before being considered complete. Every task, user story, or feature must satisfy ALL applicable criteria listed below.

### Core Principles
- **Quality First**: No compromises on code quality or testing
- **Consistency**: All work follows established patterns and standards
- **Documentation**: Code and features are properly documented
- **Security**: Security considerations are addressed
- **Performance**: Performance implications are considered
- **Maintainability**: Code is easy to understand and maintain
